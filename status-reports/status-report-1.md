(1) What was accomplished during the week?

We have learned how to login via Google and Facebook and how to store persistent login information, as well as how to authenticate the user. We will be using the user's login ID as their ID in the database. We continued working on UI and workflow design and have updated our mockups accordingly. We have found an API to use for the tournament bracket representation and have become familiar with the API's implementation. We have compiled a gallery of images to use in designing and testing our prototypes.

(2) What challenges and issues did the team face during the week?

During our last meeting, we spent a good deal of time debating a voting mechanism, ultimately settling on a tournament bracket in which submitted photos are voted on in pairs for a predetermined amount of time, and after that time has elapsed, the photo with the most votes proceeds to the next round.

(3) What are our goals for the next week?

Integrating our individual components (e.g. adding the tournament bracket to the homepage, only showing homepage after login). Implementing necessary media queries for prototype to be viewable on mobile and desktop.
