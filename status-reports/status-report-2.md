(1) What was accomplished during the week?

We've successfully implemented file uploading into the Mongo database and from the database. We've continued to work on user login/authenication, the tournament bracket API, and UI/UX as individuals. We are meeting as a team to incorporate our individual tasks/modules into a unified preliminary prototype this weekend.

(2) What challenges and issues did the team face during the week?

We did not accomplish many tasks over the duration of Thanksgiving break.

(3) What are our goals for the next week?

Integrating our individual components (e.g. adding the tournament bracket to the homepage, only showing homepage after login). Implementing necessary media queries for prototype to be viewable on mobile and desktop.
