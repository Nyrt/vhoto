(1) What was accomplished during the week?

This week we learned how to store images in MongoDB, how to upload images to the website, we created a countdown clock that displays until the voting period starts, and now have a vote prototype.


(2) What challenges and issues did the team face during the week?

With time running out, it's becoming clear that it will be impossible to implement all the features that we originally intended to.  We spent a good amount of time this week debating what we should keep and what should go.

(3) What are our goals for the next week?

Finishing up and having a workable product that we can present on December 13th.
